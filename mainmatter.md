# Introduction {#Introduction}

[@I-D.ietf-oauth-mtls] describes methods to bind (sender-constrain) access tokens
using mutual Transport Layer Security (TLS) authentication with X.509
certificates. 

[@I-D.ietf-oauth-token-binding] provides mechanisms to
sender-constrain access tokens using HTTP token binding.

Due to a sub-par user experience of TLS client authentication in user
agents and a lack of support for HTTP token binding, neither mechanism
can be used if an OAuth client is a Single Page Application (SPA)
running in a web browser.

This document outlines an application-level sender-constraining for
access tokens and refresh tokens that can be used if neither mTLS nor
OAuth Token Binding are available. It uses proof-of-possession based on
a public/private key pair and application-level signing.

DPoP can be used with public clients and, in case of confidential clients, can be combined with any client authentication method.
